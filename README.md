## TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition (BWCE) on the AWS Cloud


TThis Quick Start sets up an AWS architecture and deploys TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition (BWCE) on the AWS Cloud, using Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) host instances and an Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repository for plug-ins.

TIBCO BusinessWorks Container Edition is an integration product suite that enables you to create services and applications in a visual, model-driven development environment. It provides a drag-and-drop graphical development environment, a graphical data mapper, and a large library of connectors, including plug-ins for Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP), data conversion, Microsoft Dynamics CRM, Apache Kafka, MongoDB, IBM WebSphere MQ, OData, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.

The Quick Start offers two deployment options:

- Deploying TIBCO BWCE into a new virtual private cloud (VPC) on AWS
- Deploying TIBCO BWCE into an existing VPC on AWS

You can also use the AWS CloudFormation templates as a starting point for your own implementation.
